/**
 * Build: src/  ->  dist/plugin.js
 *
 * Why this exists (see spec section 2): an Amplenote plugin is a single self-contained JS
 * expression pasted into one code block in a note. No imports, no npm at runtime.
 * Editing that as one hand-maintained file is unworkable, so we author normal ES
 * modules in src/ and bundle them down to the single expression Amplenote wants.
 *
 * Output shape matters. Amplenote evaluates the code block and expects the result to
 * be the plugin object. We therefore wrap the whole bundle in an IIFE that RETURNS the
 * default export, so dist/plugin.js is one expression evaluating to the plugin object.
 * That form is safe whether Amplenote evals it, wraps it in `return (...)`, or parses
 * it as an object literal position.

/**
 * Compress the embed stylesheet on its way into the bundle.
 *
 * WHY A PLUGIN AND NOT JUST TIDIER CSS. src/embed/styles.js exports the stylesheet as a
 * template literal, and esbuild has no idea that string is CSS - `minify: true` compresses
 * the JS around it and ships the string byte for byte. That put 33.5k characters into a
 * note capped at 100k, 22k of them comments, at a point where the whole bundle had about
 * 1k of headroom left. Minifying here recovers roughly a quarter of the note.
 *
 * The transform is esbuild's own CSS minifier rather than a regex: a regex that strips
 * "comments" also eats the "//" inside a url(), and one that collapses whitespace joins
 * selectors across a newline. This parses the CSS properly or fails loudly.
 *
 * JSON.stringify, not a re-emitted template literal, so a backtick or a "${" that someone
 * later writes into the CSS cannot escape the string and silently corrupt the bundle.
 *
 * THE MATCH IS ASSERTED. If styles.js is ever reshaped - renamed export, a second
 * declaration, a helper alongside it - this must fail the build rather than quietly pass
 * the file through unminified and let the note creep back over its cap months later.

/**
 * Strip the embed markup's HTML comments on their way into the bundle.

 * its cap. esbuild's minifier removes JS comments, so the long explanations in viewer.js
 * cost the note nothing; the ones in src/embed/html.js are `<!-- ... -->` INSIDE a
 * template literal, which is string data to a JS minifier and ships byte for byte. There
 * were 7,908 characters of them - 8% of a note capped at 100k - at a point where the
 * bundle had about 1,000 characters of headroom left.
 *
 * A regex over the module source, unlike the stylesheet's real CSS parser, so it is
 * deliberately narrow: only `<!--`/`-->` pairs, nothing about whitespace. Collapsing
 * indentation would save more and would also change rendering, because whitespace between
 * inline elements is a text node the browser lays out.
 *
 * TWO ASSERTIONS, for the two ways this can silently stop working: no comments found at
 * all (the file was reshaped, and the note quietly creeps back over its cap), and a `${}`
 * inside a comment (an interpolation would be deleted with it, which would remove real
 * markup rather than an explanation).
